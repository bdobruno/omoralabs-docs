## Overview

You know how most finance departments work: the accounting team runs the book on the traditional ERP, you download all the data into your spreadsheet, then grab the numbers from file `budget_v3_approved.xlsx`.

This approach works well until you want to scale, add new business units or have to handle multiple entities with different currencies. The solution looks bright and shiny: implement a more powerful tool that runs all of this out of box. Except that they don't integrate with your CRM, so you don't really know how many new customers you added last month. Nor they can run a cash runway calculation depending on a set of inputs. Not to speak of 7 months implementations and 12-month running contracts.

This is what omoralabs/cf aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:

- Finance as Software: each part of the finance workflow is defined once, done once, completed once. Just like software.
- Composition: Every block uses components locked in and defined first.
- Single Source of Truth: The components and blocks should be served from your existing stack, without long implementations. Instead, dial-in -> plug-in.
- No Vendor Lock In: Built on top of modern, blazing fast open source tools and beaufitul UI tools.
- AI Ready: Open code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.

## AI-Ready

The design of omoralabs/cf makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code. Its open code and consistent API allow AI models to read, understand, and even generate new components.

An AI model can learn how your components work and suggest improvements or even create new components that integrate with your existing composition.
