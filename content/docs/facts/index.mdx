## What are Facts?

Facts store what actually happened. They record observed financial values, such as amounts, counts, or quantities, at a clearly defined level of detail, always by referencing [semantic layers](/semantic-layers) like Periods, GL Accounts, Value Types, or Revenue Types.

Every fact table links one or more semantic dimensions and attaches measurable values, ensuring observations are consistently classified, comparable, and reusable across transformations and reporting.

Facts are the inputs to the [transformation](/transformations) layer. They provide stable, auditable observations that transformations consume to produce analytical models, which are then exposed to reporting and BI without redefining classifications or business logic.
