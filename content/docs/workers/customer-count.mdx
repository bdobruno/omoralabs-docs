export const table_name = "customer_count"

## Purpose

This worker populates the [Customer Count](/facts/customer-count) fact table with customer growth metrics derived from revenue events and starting balances.

It provides a consistent, auditable view of customer acquisition, churn, and total customer base evolution across time and value types.

## Inputs

The worker consumes two dataframes provided by Omora Labs database interfaces:

- [Revenue Changes](/facts/revenue-changes)
- [Revenue Starting Balance](/facts/revenue-starting-balance)

## External Data Source

None.

## Work

The worker executes the following steps:

1. Calculates net new customers as `New Bookings - Churn`
2. Computes the cumulative net new customers over time per value type.
3. Sets the customers starting balance for each period
4. Computes the ending balance as cumulative net new customers + starting balance

## Orchestrator

A simple orchestrator suffices for handling the inputs and the worker:

<ReadComponents filePath={`registry/workers/${table_name}/orchestrator.py`}/>

## Output

The worker produces a dataframe compatible with the [Customer Count](/facts/customer-count) fact table.
