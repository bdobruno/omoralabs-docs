title: MRR View
description: Computes monthly recurring revenue balances and movements from revenue changes and starting customer balances.

export const table_name = "mrr_view"

## Purpose

This worker populates the [MRR View](/facts/mrr-view) facts table with derived MRR balances and movement metrics.

It translates customer-level revenue changes into MRR-level metrics, producing a consistent monthly view of:
- Net New MRR
- Cumulative MRR movements
- Starting MRR balance
- Ending MRR balance

The output serves as the foundational revenue fact used by downstream transformations such as [ARR](/transformations/arr-aggregated), [Retention](/transformations/retention), [GTM Efficiency](/transformations/gtm-efficiency), or [LTV](/transformations/ltv).

## Inputs

The worker consumes two dataframes provided by Omora Labs database interfaces:

- [Revenue Changes](/facts/revenue-changes)
- [Revenue Starting Balance](/facts/revenue-starting-balance)

## External Data Source

None.

## Work

The worker executes the following steps:

1. Convert customers to MRR
2. Compute net new MRR per period
3. Accumulate MRR movements
4. Derive balances
5. Materialize outputs

<ReadComponents filePath={`registry/workers/${table_name}/worker.py`}/>

## Orchestrator

A simple orchestrator suffices for handling the inputs and the worker:

<ReadComponents filePath={`registry/workers/${table_name}/orchestrator.py`}/>

## Output

The worker produces three datasets:

- It populates [MRR View](/facts/mrr-view) facts table
- It enriches field `total_mrr` on [Revenue Changes](/facts/revenue-changes) facts table
- It enriches field `total_mrr` on [Revenue Starting Balance](/facts/revenue-starting-balance) facts table
