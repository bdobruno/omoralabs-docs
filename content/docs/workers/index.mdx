## What are Workers?

Workers are **automation agents** that generate and maintains [facts](/facts). They run predefined tasks to ingest, compute, and update facts by applying existing semantic contracts without redefining business meaning.

Think of them as the **engines that populate fact tables**, ensuring observed data is produced consistently, on schedule, and in a form that downstream transformations and reporting can rely on.
