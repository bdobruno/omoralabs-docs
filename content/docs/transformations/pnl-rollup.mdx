title: PnL Rollup
description: Recursively aggregates PnL values across the GL account hierarchy for reporting.
---

export const table_name = "pnl_rollup"
export const caption = "PnL Raw Data with aggregated values for each parent GL"

## Purpose

Produce a reporting-ready PnL dataset where amounts are available at all GL hierarchy levels, not just leaf accounts.
This model centralizes hierarchical aggregation logic so downstream consumers do not need to reimplement it.

## Business Logic

- Start from atomic PnL entries at the lowest GL account level
- Use the GL account hierarchy to identify parent–child relationships
- Recursively propagate amounts from child accounts to all parent accounts
- Aggregate amounts per:
  - Period
  - GL account (leaf and parent)
  - Value Type

## Output Contract
