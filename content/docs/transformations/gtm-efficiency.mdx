title: GTM Efficiency
description: Measures go-to-market efficiency by calculating customer acquisition cost from sales and marketing expenses.

export const table_name = "gtm_efficiency"
export const caption = "Sales, marketing, and blended CAC by period and value type."

## Purpose

Provide a go-to-market efficiency view, translating sales and marketing spend into customer acquisition cost (CAC) metrics.

This model is designed as a unit-economics reporting layer, enabling:
- Tracking sales and marketing efficiency over time
- Comparing pure sales CAC vs blended sales & marketing CAC
- Supporting LTV/CAC and payback analyses

It connects GTM spending with customer growth outcomes.

## Business Logic

- Start from [PnL Rollup](/transformations/pnl-rollup)
- Isolate GTM cost categories:
  - Sales costs `gl_id = 4010`
  - Marketing costs `gl_id = 4020`
- Join with [Customer Count View](/transformations/customer-count-view)
- Normalize costs by number of new customers acquired
- Produce one row per date and value type
