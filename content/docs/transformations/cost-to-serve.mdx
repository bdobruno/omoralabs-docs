title: Cost to Serve
description: Calculates average customer support cost per customer using P&L data and customer counts.
---

export const table_name = "cost_to_serve"
export const caption = "Customer support cost per customer by period and value type."

## Purpose

Provide a cost-to-serve view at the customer level, translating customer support expenses into an average cost to serve per customer.

This model is designed as an efficiency and unit-economics reporting layer, enabling:
- Monitoring customer support cost scalability
- Comparison of cost-to-serve across periods

It connects operational cost data with customer scale.

## Business Logic

- Start from [PnL Rollup](/transformations/pnl-rollup)
- Filter to customer support–related costs (gl_id = 4030)
- Join with [Customer Count View](/transformations/customer-count-view)
- Divide total support cost by ending customer count
- Default missing or zero-customer cases to 0
- Produce one row per date and value type
