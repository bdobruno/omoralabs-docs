title: Retention
description: Calculates gross and net revenue retention, churn, and logo retention from aggregated MRR and customer counts.
---

export const table_name = "retention"
export const caption = "Revenue and logo retention metrics derived from MRR and customer counts."

## Purpose

Provide a standardized retention metrics view, translating MRR movements and customer churn into commonly used SaaS retention KPIs.

This model is designed as a diagnostic reporting layer, enabling:
- Gross Revenue Retention and Net Revenue Retention analysis
- Separation of revenue churn vs logo churn
- Comparable retention metrics across periods and scenarios

It aligns revenue-based and quantity-based retention perspectives in a single table.

## Business Logic

- Start from [MRR Aggregated](/transformations/mrr-aggregated)
- Join with [Customer Count View](/transformations/customer-count-view)
- Calculate retention metrics using current-period MRR as the baseline
- Express all outputs as ratios (percent-ready)
- Produce one row per date and value type
