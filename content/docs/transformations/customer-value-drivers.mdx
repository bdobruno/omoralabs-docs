title: Customer Value Drivers
description: Decomposes changes in average customer value into base, acquisition, and churn-driven effects.

export const table_name = "customer_value_drivers"
export const caption = "Drivers of period-over-period changes in average customer value."

## Purpose

Provide a driver-based view of customer value evolution, attributing period-over-period changes in average customer value to underlying customer dynamics.

This model is designed as an explanatory reporting layer, enabling:

- Attribution of ARPA changes to customer mix effects
- Separation of acquisition, retention, and churn impacts
- Clear reconciliation between customer value levels and movements

It shifts the analysis from what changed to what caused the change.

## Business Logic

- Start from [Customer Value](/transformations/customer-value)
- Join with [Customer Count View](/transformations/customer-count-view)
- Compute period-over-period deltas using `LAG`
- Attribute customer value changes proportionally based on customer mix:
  - Existing customer base
  - New customers
  - Churned customers
- Ensure driver components reconcile to total customer value change
- Exclude the first period where lagged values are unavailable
