title: LTV
description: Calculates customer lifetime value and unit economics ratios using gross margin, retention, and CAC metrics.

export const table_name = "ltv"
export const caption = "Customer lifetime value, payback, and LTV/CAC efficiency metrics."

## Purpose

Provide a unit-economics view, combining revenue quality, customer lifetime, and go-to-market efficiency into a single, decision-ready table.

This model is designed as the top-layer KPI model, enabling:
- LTV and LTV/CAC benchmarking
- Payback period analysis
- Validation of GTM scalability and business sustainability

It consolidates previously derived metrics into one coherent economic picture.

## Business Logic

- Start from [PnL Metrics](/transformations/pnl-metrics)
- Isolate gross margin `gl_id = 3000`
- Join with [Customer Count View](/transformations/customer-count-view) to derive ARPU
- Join with [GTM Efficiency](/transformations/gtm-efficiency) for CAC and [Retention](/transformations/retention) for churn and lifetime
- Compute:
  - ARPU = Gross Margin / Active Customers
  - ARPU / CAC ratio
  - Payback period = 1 / (ARPU / CAC)
  - Customer lifetime = 1 / churn rate
  - LTV = ARPU × Customer lifetime
  - LTV / CAC ratio
- Default undefined divisions to 0
- Produce one row per date and value type
