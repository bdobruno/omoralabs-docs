title: ARR Aggregated
description: Aggregates annual recurring revenue (ARR) metrics derived from monthly MRR data for reporting and analysis.
---

export const table_name = "arr_aggregated"
export const caption = "Annualized recurring revenue metrics aggregated by date and value type."

## Purpose

Provide an **ARR-level view of recurring revenue**, converting monthly recurring revenue (MRR) components into annual equivalents for high-level financial reporting.

This model is designed as a lightweight reporting layer, enabling:

- ARR-based performance reporting
- Comparison of revenue components on an annual basis
- Alignment with budgeting, planning, and valuation metrics

It removes monthly granularity while preserving revenue structure and time dimensions.

## Business Logic

- Start from [MRR Aggregated](/transformations/mrr-aggregated)
- Retain all dimensional columns (e.g. date, value_type)
- Annualize revenue components by multiplying monthly values by 12
- Produce one row per date and value type
