title: MRR Aggregated
description: Consolidated monthly recurring revenue view enriched with revenue change decomposition by driver.
---

export const table_name = "mrr_aggregated"
export const caption = "Monthly recurring revenue metrics decomposed by revenue driver and value type."

## Purpose

Provide a single, analysis-ready MRR table, combining balance-style MRR metrics with flow-based revenue change drivers.

This model is designed as the MRR reporting layer, enabling:
- MRR bridges and waterfalls
- Plan vs actual vs forecast comparison
- Consistent revenue movement analysis across periods

It centralizes MRR logic and removes the need to join multiple revenue tables downstream.

## Business Logic

- Start from [MRR View](/facts/mrr-view)
- Join with [Revenue Changes](/facts/revenue-changes)
- Map revenue change types to business drivers:
    - New customers
    - Upsell
    - Downsell
    - Churn
- Produce one row per date and value type

## Output Contract

| Column         | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| date           | Date of the MRR snapshot (`YYYY-MM-DD`)             |
| value_type     | Indicator such as `actual`, `budget` |
| current_base   | MRR from existing customers at period start         |
| new_customers  | MRR added from new customer acquisition             |
| upsell         | MRR added from expansions                           |
| downsell       | MRR lost from contractions                          |
| churn          | MRR lost from customer churn                        |
| net_new_mrr    | Net change in MRR over the period                   |
| ending_balance | Total MRR at period end                             |
