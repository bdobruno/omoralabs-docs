title: LTV Drivers
description: Decomposes period-over-period changes in customer lifetime value into ARPU and lifetime effects.
---

export const table_name = "ltv_drivers"
export const caption = "Drivers of changes in customer lifetime value (LTV) over time."

## Purpose

Provide a driver-based view of customer lifetime value, attributing period-over-period changes in LTV to changes in monetization and retention dynamics.

This model is designed as an explanatory and analytics layer, enabling:
- Clear attribution of LTV expansion or contraction

It turns LTV from a black-box KPI into explainable metric.

## Business Logic

- Start from [LTV](/transformations/ltv)
- Compute period-over-period deltas using `LAG`
- Attribute LTV change into:
  - ARPU effect: changes in ARPU
  - Lifetime effect: changes in customer lifetime
- Ensure driver components reconcile to total LTV change
- Exclude the first period where lagged values are unavailable

## Output Contract
