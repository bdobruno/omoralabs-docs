title: Customer Value
description: Derives average customer value metrics by dividing ARR components by customer counts.
---

export const table_name = "customer_value"
export const caption = "Average ARR value per customer by date and value type."

## Purpose

Provide a customer-level value view of recurring revenue, translating aggregated ARR metrics into average value per customer for analytical and strategic use.

This model is designed as a derived reporting layer, enabling:

- Average revenue per customer (ARPC / ARPA) analysis
- Comparison of customer quality across periods and movements
- Insight into acquisition vs retention value dynamics

It removes scale effects by normalizing revenue against customer counts.

## Business Logic

- Start from [ARR Aggregated](/transformations/arr-aggregated)
- Join with [Customer Count View](/transformations/customer-count-view)
- Derive ARR base as `current_base + upsell − downsell`
- Divide ARR components by their respective customer counts
- Produce one row per date and value type
