title: GTM Efficiency Drivers
description: Decomposes period-over-period changes in CAC into cost and customer volume drivers.

export const table_name = "gtm_efficiency_drivers"
export const caption = "Drivers of changes in blended sales & marketing CAC over time."

## Purpose

Provide a driver-based view of go-to-market efficiency, attributing changes in customer acquisition cost to underlying sales spend, marketing spend, and customer volume dynamics.

This model is designed as an explanatory analytics layer, enabling:
- Attribution of CAC inflation or deflation
- Separation of spend-driven vs growth-driven efficiency changes
- Clear reconciliation between CAC levels and CAC movements

It shifts the analysis from metric tracking to cause analysis.

## Business Logic

- Start from [GTM Efficiency](/transformations/gtm-efficiency)
- Join with [Customer Count View](/transformations/customer-count-view)
- Compute period-over-period deltas using `LAG`
- Attribute CAC change into:
  - Sales cost changes
  - Marketing cost changes
  - New customer volume effects
- Ensure driver components reconcile to total CAC change
- Exclude the first period where lagged values are unavailable
